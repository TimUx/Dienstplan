                    FEBRUARY 2026 PLANNING FIX - SUMMARY
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
--------
When planning February 2026 after January 2026 was already planned:
  ✗ INFEASIBLE error
  ✗ Many warnings about conflicting locked shifts
  ✗ Planning fails completely

CAUSE:
------
  • February 2026: Feb 1 (Sun) - Feb 28 (Sat) = 28 days
  • Extended to complete weeks: Jan 26 (Mon) - Mar 1 (Sun) = 35 days
  • System loads existing shifts from Jan 26-31 as locked constraints
  • Tries to convert employee locks → team locks
  • Conflict: Different team members worked different days in overlapping week
  • Result: Conflicting team constraints → INFEASIBLE

SOLUTION:
---------
File: model.py, Lines 204-208

  Added check to skip team-level lock conversion for dates outside 
  the original planning period (dates from adjacent months).

  • Employee-level locks: Still enforced (prevents double shifts)
  • Team-level locks: Only for dates within target month (prevents conflicts)

CODE CHANGE:
------------
  +    # CRITICAL FIX: Only convert employee locks to team locks for dates
  +    # WITHIN the original planning period
  +    if d < self.original_start_date or d > self.original_end_date:
  +        # This date is in the extended portion (adjacent month)
  +        # Don't convert to team lock - employee lock is sufficient
  +        continue

RESULT:
-------
  ✅ January 2026 planning works
  ✅ February 2026 planning works (with locked shifts from January)
  ✅ March 2026 and beyond work
  ✅ No double shifts
  ✅ No INFEASIBLE errors
  ✅ Sequential month planning enabled
